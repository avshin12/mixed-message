# About

Off platform - group project. Forked from repo @ https://github.com/danil0man/mixed-message for resume purposes.

Our own idea: This app will generate a meal from a specified menu depending on the time of day and day of the week it is run.

My role: "Back-end" and "Project Manager"
  - created json file to store data
  - created a XMLHttpRequest (XHR) web request to json file
  - added DOMContentLoaded event listener
  - used kanban and discord to manage project across 3 different time zones and 2 countries (USA & Sweden)
